 * a CONTRIBUTION.md file is now assumed in project dir (instead of doc/Contributing.md)
 * we assume a LICENSE.md now
 * added some scaffolding files to the nuget package
 * NuGet is now build on ./build All (as test on CI and to allow users to use them internally, its pretty fast anyway)

### 0.1.1

 * Fix invalid backward slash on linux.
 * Don't ask for task and branch push (use "git flow" and push manually!)


### 0.1.0

 * Initial release
