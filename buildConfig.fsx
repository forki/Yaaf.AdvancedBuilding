# Yaaf.AdvancedBuilding buildConfig.fsx configuration

This file handles the configuration of the Yaaf.AdvancedBuilding build script.

The first step is handled in `build.sh` and `build.cmd` by restoring either paket dependencies or bootstrapping a NuGet.exe and
executing NuGet to resolve all build dependencies (dependencies required for the build to work, for example FAKE).
For details of paket look into http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/ .

To be able to update `build.sh` and `build.cmd` with Yaaf.AdvancedBuilding the `build.sh` and `build.cmd` files in the project root directory delegate to
`packages/Yaaf.AdvancedBuilding/content/build.sh` and `packages/Yaaf.AdvancedBuilding/content/build.cmd`, which do the actual work.

When using NuGet instead of paket (or when using both), nuget packages from a `packages.config` file are restored.
This only works if there is a NuGet.exe found, you can just drop the `downloadNuget.fsx` file in your project root and Yaaf.AdvancedBuilding will make sure to
bootstrap a NuGet.exe into `packages/Nuget.CommandLine`.


The second step is to invoke FAKE with `build.fsx` which loads the current `buildConfig.fsx` file and delegates the work to
`packages/Yaaf.AdvancedBuilding/content/buildInclude.fsx`. For details about FAKE look into http://fsharp.github.com/FAKE .

In the remainder of this document we will explain the various configuration options for Yaaf.Configuration.

## Required config start

First We need to load some dependencies and open some namespaces.

## Main project configuration

Then we need to set some general properties of the project.

With `UseNuget` you can specify if Yaaf.AdvancedBuilding should restore nuget packages
before running the build (if you only use paket, you either leave it out or use the default setting = false).

## The `GeneratedFileList` property

The `GeneratedFileList` list is used to specify which files are copied over to the release directory.
This list is also used for documentation generation.
Defaults to [ x.ProjectName + ".dll"; x.ProjectName + ".xml" ] which is only enough for very simple projects.

You can change which AssemblyInfo files are generated for you.

enable mdb2pdb and pdb2mdb conversation for paket/nuget packages and your package.
Note that mdb2pdb only works on windows so to get a cross platform debugging experience you:
 - either include the pdb file and can therefore only release on a windows machine
 - include a mdb and tell your users to use mdb2pdb on windows.

## FAKE settings

You can setup FAKE variables as well.

## Remove ME!
This is specific to the Yaaf.AdvancedBuilding project, you can safely remove everything below.
